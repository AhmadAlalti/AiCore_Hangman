# Hangman
- This hangman game allows the user to play hangman, through python code, by trying to guess the word. 
- It will ask the user to input a letter and check if the letter is in the word.
- This will then reflect through the number of lives remaining and the letters remaining to be guessed.
- A class called Hangman was used and several methods in that class were called to make the game folow the right logic.
